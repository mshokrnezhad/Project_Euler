# Project Euler

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Please note that Project Euler encourages users to solve problems on their own before looking at others' solutions. Use this repository responsibly and try to solve the problems yourself first!  

## About This Project  

The purpose of this project is to:  
1. Improve my problem-solving skills.
2. Enhance my understanding of mathematics and algorithms.
3. Practice coding in Python.  

## Structure  

Each problem has its own directory named `problem_XXX`, where XXX is the problem number. Inside each directory, you'll find:  

- The problem definition 
- The solution code  
- A brief explanation of the approach (if required)  
- Any additional resources or references used (if used)

## Progress  

- [âœ“] Problem 1: [Problem Title]   
...  

## Lessons Learned  

### Problem 1: [Problem Title]  
- [Key lesson or insight gained]  
- [New concept or algorithm learned]  
- [Any interesting optimization techniques used]

## Contributing  

While this is a personal project, I welcome discussions about the problems and solutions. Feel free to open an issue if you'd like to discuss a particular problem or solution approach.
