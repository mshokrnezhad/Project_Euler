This repository contains my solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Please note that Project Euler encourages users to solve problems on their own before looking at others' solutions. Use this repository responsibly and try to solve the problems yourself first!  

## About This Project  

The purpose of this project is to:  
1. Improve my problem-solving skills.
2. Enhance my understanding of mathematics and algorithms.
3. Practice coding in Python.  

## Structure  

Each problem has its own directory named `problem_XXX`, where XXX is the problem number. Inside each directory, you'll find:  

- The problem definition 
- The solution code  
- A brief explanation of the approach (if required)  
- Any additional resources or references used (if used)

## Lessons Learned  

### [Problem 001: Multiples of 3 or 5](problem_001)
- **Key lesson or insight gained:**   
  The problem introduces the concept of finding multiples and summing them. It's a good exercise in using modulo operations and conditional statements.  
- **New concept or algorithm learned:**  
  While this problem doesn't require advanced algorithms, it reinforces the use of the modulo operator (`%`) to check for divisibility. It's a simple yet effective way to identify multiples.  
- **Interesting optimization techniques:**  
  1. We could optimize this solution by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, reducing the time complexity from `O(n)` to `O(1)`.  
  2. We could use a set to avoid double-counting numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 (like 15).
